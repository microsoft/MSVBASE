# MSVBASE
## What's NEW
New Research Paper [VBASE: Unifying Online Vector Similarity Search and Relational Queries via Relaxed Monotonicity](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi23-zhang-qianxi_1.pdf) - _published in OSDI 2023_
## What's MSVBASE
MSVBASE is a new system capable of efficiently serving complex online queries that involve both approximate similarity search and relational operators on scalar and vector data-sets. MSVBASE builds a unified query execution engine to support a wide range of queries both on scalar and vector data, and shows superior query performance and accuracy.
It integrates high-dimensional vector indices into PostgreSQL with minimal code modifications.

## **Quickstart**
### **Clone and Patch**
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MSVBASE.git
cd MSVBASE
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/patch.sh
```
### **Build**
```
./scripts/dockerbuild.sh
```

### **Run**
```
./scripts/dockerrun.sh
```

## **Features and SQL syntax**
It is compatible with PostgreSQL syntax and protocol, supporting vector distance calculations for L2 and Inner product. It also supports [hnsw](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) and [sptag](https://github.com/microsoft/SPTAG/) indices. Soon, we are going to integrate spann and more indices.
### **Command Line**
```
docker exec -it --privileged --user=root vbase_open_source bash
psql -U vectordb
```

### **SQL syntax**
It preserves all the features of PostgreSQL while extending query support on vector data.
* Currently, 'float array' is used to store vectors.
```
create table t_table(id int, price int, vector_1 float8[10], vector_2 float8[10]);
```
* Insert or Import data.
```
insert into t_table values(1, 10, '{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}', '{5,6,7,1,2,3,4,8,9,1}');
copy t_table from 'your_data_path.tsv' DELIMITER E'\t' csv quote e'\x01';
```
* When creating a vector index, it is necessary to specify the algorithm and the distance calculation method to be used.
```
create index vector_index_1 on t_table using hnsw(vector_1) with(dimension=10,distmethod=l2_distance);
create index vector_index_2 on t_table using sptag(vector_2) with(dimension=10,distmethod=inner_product_distance);
```
* **TopK**. When calculating distances, the '<->' operator represents the L2 distance, while '<*>' represents the inner product distance.
```
select id from t_table order by vector_1 <-> '{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}' limit 10;
select id from t_table order by vector_2 <*> '{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}' limit 5;
```
* **TopK + Filter**.
```
select id from t_table where price > 15 order by vector_1 <-> '{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}' limit 10;
select id from t_table where price > 15 order by vector_2 <*> '{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}' limit 5;
```
* **Distance Range Filter**. It also supports distance threshold-based filtering queries. The query will retrieve vector data that is within the distance threshold.
In the query, the '<<->>' operator represents the L2 distance, while '<<*>>' represents the inner product distance.
The first element of the array represents the distance threshold.
```
select id from t_table where price > 15 and vector_1 <<->> '{30,5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}';
```
* **Multi-vector Column Query**.
```
select id from t_table
order by approximate_sum('0.5 * vector_1<->{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3} + vector_2<*>{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}' ) limit 5;
```
* **Join**. Join on vector similarity with threshold
```
select t_table.id as tid, d_table.id as did
from t_table join d_table
on t_table.vector_2 <<*>> array_cat(ARRAY[cast(10 as float8)], d_table.vector_2);
```

* Example
```
create database test;
\c test;
create extension vectordb;
create table t_table(id int, price int, vector_1 float8[10]);
insert into t_table values(1, 10, '{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}');
insert into t_table values(2, 20, '{5,6,7,1,2,3,4,8,9,1}');
insert into t_table values(3, 30, '{9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0}');
create index t4_index on t_table using hnsw(vector_1) with(dimension=10,distmethod=l2_distance);
set enable_seqscan=false;
select id from t_table where price > 15 order by vector_1 <-> '{5,9,8,6,2,1,1,0,4,3}' limit 1;
insert into t_table values(4, 40, '{19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10}');
delete from t_table where id = 2;
```
